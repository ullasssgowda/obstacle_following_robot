# obstacle_following_robot
The Obstacle-Following Robot is an autonomous system built using ESP32 and programmed in Embedded C. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect and follow a moving object while avoiding obstacles in real time. The ESP32 processes sensor data and controls the motors via an L298N motor driver, adjusting movement accordingly.
